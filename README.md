# LLM-Fine-Tuning-and-Few-Shot-Learning

 

## Description  
This project explores the fine-tuning of a large language model (LLM) while also leveraging a few-shot learning approach. It includes model training, hyperparameter optimization, and performance evaluation to achieve the best results.  

## Content  
- **Notebook**: Contains the code for fine-tuning the LLM  
- **Data**: Datasets used for training and evaluation  
- **Few-Shot Examples**: Demonstrations used for few-shot learning  
- **Results**: Performance analysis and comparisons
